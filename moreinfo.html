            <h2>Racquet Club information</h3>
        <br>
            <p >
                Racquet Club is an indoor tennis facility that has a lot of people I've seen from other schools and my school. A lot of people including me transfered over from Olympic as there are more people. It is closer to our location making travel time less and easier. At Racquet club the drills they run through keep you moving all the time. The beginning classes start off with drills for beginners to ingrain the motions into them. While the beginning classes of more advances groups starts with warming up and different games that help us work on our consistiency.

            <h2>Olympic information</h3>
        <hr><br>
            <p>
                Olympic, like Racquet club is an indoor tennis facility. There is where I began to play tennis. There are classes you can take that are for people of all levels from beginners to pros. They ocassionally go over drills to keep us practicing at the basics. The class I was last in focused a lot more on playing against opponents you are unfamiliar with.
