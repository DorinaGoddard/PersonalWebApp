            <h3>Overview of my tennis life</h3>
            <p>I started playing tennis around 6th grade at Olympic. Olympic is an indoor tennis facility for people who can take personal classes, attend match play, or play with friends in groups. I started playing because my dad has been playing for years. I ended up joining the Olentangy Middle School tennis team in 8th grade. I have been on The Olentangy High School team and climbed my way up to varsity. After a couple of years at Olympic, I moved on to play at Racquet Club. Racquet Club is silimar to Olympic except it is a bit closer to me and more people I know go there. </p>
