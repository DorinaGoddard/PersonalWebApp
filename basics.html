            <ul> <b>Racquet gripping</b> </ul>
            <ul>Before learning the different strokes you need to know about your racquet grip. There are differnt grips for each swing that will be covered later on.</ul>

            <ul>Tennis court body and lines</ul>
            <ul>On a tennis court, the lines are everything. On the diagram below, the back line is the <b>Base line</b> where you stand to begin a game. The big area in front of the base line is called <b>No-mans land </b>. Ths reason for this is because it is a bad place to stand when a ball is coming because it will hit the ground around where your feet are. Most people struggle to hit a ball that is at their feet. 
            
            The line in front of the no mans land is the <b>service line</b>. This is one of the lines that dictate if a serve is in or out. 
            
            The 2 boxes that touch the service line are the <b>service boxes</b>. When you serve, the ball must go in the box. On your side of the court, the <b>side is called the ad side</b> while the <b>right side is the deuce side</b>. 
            
            The 2 side lines that reaches from the net to the base line is the <b>alley line</b>. If the ball hits the alley in a 1v1 (singles) match, the ball is out. If the ball hits the alley during a 2v2 (doubles) match, the ball is in. The lines are part of the court so as long as the ball touches the line, the point continues. </ul>

        <ol>
            <ul><b>Scoring</b></ul>
            <ul><i>Scores</i> during a game in tennis is very important. During a game the server should say their score than their opponents score. The scoring goes: 15, 30, 40. If both sides reach 40 then the score becomes deuce, during a no-add game, the next point determines the winner. If there is add scoring, the server will say add in if they won the deuce point or add out if they lost. During deuce points the game could essentially last forever.</ul>
        <br>
            <ul class="strokes"> <b>Serving</b></ul>
            <ul><i>Serving</i> is probably the most important part in tennis. Without serving, you can't win a game. In a game, you have 2 tries at a serve to begin the game. With the dominant hand the racquet will be held while holding the ball in your non dominant hand. Your racquet will be held behind your back like a back scratcher while you toss the ball. Your racquet you will hit the ball when the ball falls down  </ul>
        <br>
            <ul class="strokes"><b>Forehand Groundstroke</b></ul>
            <ul>A <i>Forehand</i> stroke is one of the 2 groundstrokes that is sort of like a side swing to hit the ball. The stroke is a low to high swing typically done with your dominant arm on your dominant side. Some professionals who play tennis a lot can get tennis elbow making one hand swings hurt so they will hold the racquet with both </ul>
        <br>
            <ul class="strokes"><b>Backhand Groundstroke</b></ul>
            <ul>A <i>Backhand</i> stroke is another one of the 2 groundstrokes. It is the same low to high swing as the forehand stroke except both hands will grab the racquet and the swing will be done on your non-dominant side.</ul>
        <br>
            <ul class="strokes"><b>Topspin</b></ul>
            <ul><i>Topspin</i> is the racquet making contact at the bottom of the ball and swinging up. This will push the ball to rotate foward you can hit deeper. Deeper means ball will be lower, near the net and still make the first bounce near in no mans land</ul>
        <br>
            <ul id="strokes"><b>Slice</b></ul>
            <ul>A <i>slice</i> or an <i>underspin</i> is the racquet making contact at the top of the ball and swinging down. This will make the ball rotate backwards so when it lands it will bounce away from your opponent. Personally this is one of my favorite shots as this messes with peoples' minds.</ul>

            <ul id="strokes"><b>Volley</b></ul>
            <ul>A <i>Volley</i> is a punch to the ball.The ball must be hit before it touches the ground otherwise it'd be a volley a groundstroke.</ul>
        <br>
            <ul class="strokes"><b>Overhead</b></ul>
            <ul>An <i>Overhead</i> is sort of like a serve except it is when your opponen</i></ul>
        <br>
            <ul class="strokes"><b>Lob</b></ul>
            <ul>A <i>Lob</i> is a groundstroke that is aimed up to hit over an opponent standing at the net.</ul>
        <br>    
            <ul id="strokes"><b>Moonball</b></ul>
            <ul>A <i>Moonball</i> is a lob except with tons of top spin so the ball can bounce higher when it hits the ground.</ul>
